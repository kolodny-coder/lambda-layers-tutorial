# 🚀 Lambda Layers Tutorial with AWS SAM 🚀

## 💡 Introduction

This repository provides a hands-on example of how to implement Lambda Layers with AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). The project focuses on creating a layer called `UUIDLayer` and a lambda function named `UUIDFunction` that uses this layer. 🎯

## 🧩 Understanding the Components

### 📝 Event File

The `event.json` file is a JSON representation of a sample event that can be used for testing purposes. It has various parameters that mimic an API Gateway Proxy request including the HTTP method, headers, path parameters, and query string parameters. This helps us simulate how our Lambda function would behave in a real-world scenario🌐(source).

### 🛠️ SAM Template

The `template.yaml` file is the heart of any AWS SAM application. It defines the resources that make up the serverless application. Let's go through it step by step:

1. **AWSTemplateFormatVersion**: It specifies the AWS CloudFormation template version that the template conforms to. 📄

2. **Transform**: It specifies the name of the macro that AWS CloudFormation uses to process your template. `AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31` indicates that this template is written in AWS SAM syntax. 🔧

3. **Description**: It provides a brief explanation about the resources that are defined in the template. 💡

4. **Globals**: Here, we are setting a global timeout for all the functions. This means that all the functions in this template will have a timeout of 3 seconds unless specifically overridden. ⏱️

5. **Resources**: This section is where we define our AWS resources: 🏗️

    - **UUIDLayer**: This is our Lambda Layer. We are specifying its type as `AWS::Serverless::LayerVersion`, giving it a name, and providing a brief description. The `ContentUri` points to the directory (`uuid-layer/`) where the layer's code resides. We also specify the runtime compatible with this layer (`nodejs18.x`).

    - **UUIDFunction**: This is our Lambda function. It's type is `AWS::Serverless::Function`. We give it a name, description, and specify the directory (`src/`) where the function's code resides. We also set the function's handler and runtime. The `Layers` field links our function with the previously defined layer using the reference `!Ref UUIDLayer`. This means our function will have access to the resources provided by `UUIDLayer`.

    - **Events**: The `UUIDApi` event is an API Gateway event. It triggers our function whenever a GET request is made to the `/uuid` path.

6. **Outputs**: This section provides details about the created resources. It includes the API Gateway endpoint URL for the function, the Lambda function's Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and the ARN of the IAM role created for the function (source).

## 🚀 Deployment Steps 🚀

Follow these steps to clone and deploy the repository:

1. **Clone the repository**: Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kolodny-coder/lambda-layers-tutorial.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the cloned repository**:
    ```bash
    cd lambda-layers-tutorial
    ```
3. **Build the SAM application**: This will build any dependencies and create a deployment package.
    ```bash
    sam build
    ```


4. **Deploy the SAM application**: This will create a CloudFormation stack and deploy your resources. It will prompt for parameters, and for the first deployment, it is recommended to use default parameters. When answering the following `   UUIDFunction may not have authorization defined, Is this okay? [y/N]:
   ` reply y 
    ```bash
    sam deploy --guided
    ```

## 🧪 Testing the Function 🧪

Once the deployment is successful, you can test your function using the API endpoint that AWS SAM provides. Here's how you can do that:

1. **Get the API endpoint**: In the output of the `sam deploy` command, you will see a URL for `UUIDFunctionApi`. This is the API endpoint of your function.

2. **Send a GET request**: To test the function, you can send a GET request to this API endpoint. Here is how you can do it using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://49dxay9nu4.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/uuid'
    ```

   Replace the URL in the curl command with your own API endpoint don't forget to put the /uuid in the end. If everything is working correctly, this should return a UUID generated by your function. 🎉

## 🧹 Cleaning Up 🧹

To avoid incurring future charges, you can delete the resources created by this SAM application. Here's how you can do that:

1. **List the CloudFormation stacks**: Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation describe-stacks --query 'Stacks[].StackName'
    ```
   This will list all the CloudFormation stacks you have. Find the stack name related to this SAM application.

2. **Delete the stack**: Once you have identified the stack name (let's say it's `uuid-demo`), you can delete it using the following command:
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name uuid-demo
    ```
   Replace `uuid-demo` with your stack name.

Please note that it may take some time for AWS to delete all the associated resources. Always check in the AWS Management Console to ensure all the resources have been deleted. 🧐
